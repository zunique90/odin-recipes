    <h1>Skillet Meatballs</h1>
    <img src="../images/skillet-meatballs.jpg" alt="Skillet Meatballs" />
    <p>
      These skillet meatballs are tender on the inside and have a neutral taste,
      <br />so they can be used any way you like â€”in pasta, soup, sandwiches, or
      as appetizers.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
      <li>1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>1/2 onion</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, beat egg, and add in 1 tablespoon milk. <br>Stir in panko
        breadcrumbs; let stand for 1 minute to soften slightly. Add ground beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place onion in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely
        chopped.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion, Parmesan, garlic, salt, and pepper to the bowl of ground
        beef. <br>Using clean, gloved hands, combine mixture gently. <br>If mixture
        feels tough, add 1 tablespoon milk. Shape mixture into 1 1/2-inch
        meatballs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. <br>Place meatballs
        in a single layer, without crowding, into the skillet, <br>and cook, turning
        and moving them around every 2 or 3 minutes, <br>until well browned on all
        sides and no longer pink at the center, 10 to 14 minutes, <br>adjusting
        temperature as needed. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
        center <br>should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). You may have
        to cook meatballs in batches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove meatballs to a foil-lined drip tray. Serve with pasta and sauce
        if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
